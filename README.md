# Memory Game
### Background
This application was developed as a component of my thesis group's research project in our Grade 12 biology class. In a team of 4, we spent 5 months writing our thesis and conducting tests on how the volume of music affects the listener's ability to concentrate. To investigate this relationship, we measured the volume of music's effect on 3 components that would be affected by one's level of concentration: 

1. Reaction Time
2. Balance
3. Working Memory

This application aims to measure an individual's working memory. In our paper, we define working memory as "a cognitive system that is responsible for the temporary storage and manipulation of information," and is "related to the ability of an individual to voluntarily orient their attention to certain stimuli and suppress less relevant information." We hypothesized that intense auditory stimuli may disrupt the dopaminergic neuromodulatory system, which has been shown to inhibit neuronal firing in the prefrontal cortex. Nonetheless, with this app, we were able to provide statistically significant data that indicates an concentration and the volume of music have an inverse relationship.

### How the Game Works
A large word will appear on the screen. If you remember seeing that word on the screen in this round, then click 'Seen'. If you do not recall seeing this word, click 'Not Seen'. If you are incorrect (i.e. you say you haven't seen the word, but it has appeared or vice versa), then you lose a life. By default, you have 3 lives. For each one you get correct, your score increases by one point. The goal is simply to get the highest score possible; that is, tp get as many correct as you can before you get 3 incorrect. Note: After the first 3 words have appeared on the screen, the probability of a word re-appearing on the screen is 50%.
