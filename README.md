# Memory Game

## Overview
### Background
This application is the result of a comprehensive research project undertaken by my Grade 12 biology thesis group. Over the course of 5 months, our team of four diligently conducted experiments and wrote our thesis, focusing on the impact of music volume on concentration levels. The study delved into three key components affected by concentration:

1. Reaction Time
2. Balance
3. Working Memory

The primary goal of this application is to assess an individual's working memory. In our thesis, we define working memory as "a cognitive system responsible for the temporary storage and manipulation of information." It is intricately linked to "the ability of an individual to voluntarily orient their attention to certain stimuli and suppress less relevant information." Our hypothesis explored the potential disruption of the dopaminergic neuromodulatory system by intense auditory stimuli, which has been shown to inhibit neuronal firing in the prefrontal cortex. Through this app, we successfully gathered statistically significant data indicating an inverse relationship between concentration and the volume of music.

### How the Game Works
The game presents a large word on the screen. Participants must click 'Seen' if they remember seeing that word in the current round or 'Not Seen' if they do not recall it. Incorrect selections result in the loss of a life, with players starting with three lives by default. Each correct answer adds one point to the score. The objective is to achieve the highest possible score, accumulating correct responses before reaching three incorrect ones.

It's important to note that after the initial appearance of the first three words on the screen, there is a 50% probability of a word re-appearing in subsequent rounds. This engaging and informative game provides an interactive platform to explore the fascinating interplay between concentration and external stimuli, particularly the volume of music.
