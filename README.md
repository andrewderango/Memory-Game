# Memory Game
### Background
This application was developed as a component of my thesis group's research project in our Grade 12 biology class. In a team of 4, we spent 5 months writing our thesis and conducting tests on how the volume of music affects the listener's ability to concentrate.

How the Volume of Music Affects one's Concentration. This game was designed to measure the participants' working memory.
